## About The Project

![Public API Requests Screen Shot](https://github.com/Stelkooo/public-api-requests/blob/main/images/appScreenshot.png)

This is a browser app for a fiction company called Awesome Startup with employees working remotely over the US. With this app, the employees have a way to share contact info with each other.

It is uses JavaScript to grab information for 12 random "employees" from the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/)

A JSON object is requested from the API for 12 employees which are then listed in a grid on the browser with their image, name, email, and location.

Clicking the employee gives you more information on the employee including their birthday and address.

There is also a search function on the top right to help finding a specific employee.

I changed a few things about the styling of the app from its standard look, they include:

- The background colour
- Font
- Borders

This project is hosted on GitHub using gh-pages.

### Built With

- JavaScript
- Fetch API
