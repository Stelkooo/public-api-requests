# Public API Requests

This is a browser app for a fiction company called Awesome Startup with employees working remotely over the US. With this app, the employees have a way to share contact info with each other.

It is uses JavaScript to grab information for 12 random "employees" from the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/)

A JSON object is requested from the API for 12 employees which are then listed in a grid on the browser with their image, name, email, and location.

Clicking the employee gives you more information on the employee including their birthday and address.

There is also a search function on the top right to help finding a specific employee.

I changed a few things about the styling of the app from its standard look, they include:
- The background colour
- Font
- Borders
